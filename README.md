# LF-VCR Package

LF-VCR is an R package that provides advanced functionality for latent factor extraction and modeling. It features two primary functions—**LF_VCR** and **LF_VCR.ae**—allowing users to extract latent factors from data using different methods. **LF_VCR** extracts latent factors and fits them using a sparse group lasso, while **LF_VCR.ae** employs an autoencoder for feature extraction.

## Features

- **LF_VCR**: Uses factor analysis for latent feature extraction and does model fitting with sparse group lasso.
- **LF_VCR.ae**: Uses an autoencoder to extract features before performing subsequent analysis.
